# It-doesn-t-appear-that-localization-is-working
When utilising the card view, I'm experiencing some localization concerns; the right text e.g [url="https://cowsquishmallow.shop/"](squishmallow cow&lt) and ID are both displayed, but I'm not sure why. I thought that by enabling localisation, this would be eliminated.
